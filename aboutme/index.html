    <h3>Will Keel</h3>
    <p>
    My name is Will and I am from Herriman, UT where I was born and raised. I am transferring here from the University of Utah Computer Science 
    degree so I will get some good "refresher" material in this class that I am looking forward to. My wife, Michaela, and I are both 
    Software Development BS majors here at BYU-I. We currently live in Herriman where we enjoy camping, hiking, exploring, and we own a 
    wedding floral business together. I also enjoy fishing (I just couldn't include that in the list of things my wife likes to do with me lol), 
    building things, and working on our vehicles. 
 
    I currently am a Technical Support Engineer at a well-known Certificate Authority, DigiCert, arguably one of the most important companies 
    nobody has heard of. I have been in this role for a few years while working on my education while switching from pre-med to biochemistry 
    to pre-pharmacy to computer science and trying to figure out exactly what it is I want to do. 
 
    I also really enjoy the problem solving side of programming and look forward to learning more!
